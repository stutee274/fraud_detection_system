Considering these factors, I recommend approval, as the transaction's timing and amount align with normal spending habits, and the card's age indicates a low-risk, established customer. Approve the transaction.",
  "f270f5a43e4fb6dfcb28d734fd114c12": "This transaction is legitimate despite a 5.5% fraud risk. The top two risk factors, amount ($1,000.00) and card age (366 days), are mitigated by normal patterns detected. The card age suggests an established account, and the amount, although high, may be a one-time payment. The transaction's timing and average 7-day balance align with expected behavior. Given these factors, I recommend approving this transaction as it appears to be a genuine payment from a long-standing customer. The normal patterns detected further support this assessment, indicating a low-risk transaction. Approve the transaction."
